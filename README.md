# FREE freeCodeCamp Bootcamp

## free-freecodecamp-bootcamp

The free freeCodeCamp Bootcamp is a free online bootcamp run by Jeseekia Vaughn aka MetaDevGirl that supports freeCodeCamp students by providing them with a structured coding bootcamp experience. In it's inaugural cohort, this program is run via livestream with a Discord server community for questions, support, and collaboration.

This repository serves as a web homebase for students enrolled in the program.

# Program Timeline

Class will be hosted 2 days per week ending with open lab office hours.

***Cohort 1: Tues / Thu 6p - 9p et***

Outside of class students are expected to be following the corresponding freeCodeCamp material.

We recommend dedicating at least 20 hours per week to completing lessons, materials, and projects. 

Not everyone learns at the same pace or is starting from the same technical foundation, so this is just a starting point so you can plan appropriate time and space for your studies. If you have additional time to dedicate, for this particular 24 week pace, up to 40 hours per week is a good cap. 

Although you may feel tempted or even pressured to pack in as much time as possible, too much studying can cause burn out and become counter-productive. For those that have the capacity to study full-time (meaning you are not already working a job full time), good regular sleep as well as mental downtime from the technical overload will allow more time to fully digest and internalize the material.
